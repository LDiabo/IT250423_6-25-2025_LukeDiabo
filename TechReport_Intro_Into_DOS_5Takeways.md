# 5 Takeways from the Intro to DOS Video

- the first interesting this about this video was how you can make a shortcut with command prompt on your desktop, and then set the directory you want command prompt to start up with, rather than use the default Windows32x folder.

- the second interesting thing about this video that caught my attention around the 7:46 mark was that if you do not save your .txt file in Notepad, the file size will not reflect what it should be in your folder until you saved the changes.<br/>
 the exmaple was that there was a blank .txt file with no data on it, then when more data was being input and the file was closed, the file size remained the same until the txt. file was saved and reflected the actual file size.

- the third was around the 8:38 mark with Notepad again that you can actually change the save preferences back to the orginal state where when you would close a .txt document and it would ask you if you wanted to save or save as.

- the fourth interesting point about the video around the 12:20 mark was if you want to open a specific file in Notepad from your directory in command prompt. in command prompt, you type in "notepad" followed by the Tab key which will bring up the first file in your directory that can be opened in notepad.

- the fifth point of the video that was interesting was key commands you can use in command prompt to gather information on your pc sush as systeminfo, and ipconfig/all.
