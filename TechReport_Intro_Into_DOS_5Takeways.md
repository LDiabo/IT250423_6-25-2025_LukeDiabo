# 5 Takeways from the Intro to Dos Video

- the first interesting thing about this video that caught my attention around the 7:46 mark was that if you do not save your .txt file in Notepad, the file size will not reflect what it should be in your folder until you saved the changes.<br/>
 the exmaple was that there was a blank .txt file with no data on it, then when more data was being input and the file was closed, the file size remained the same until the txt. file was saved and reflected the actual file size.

- the second was around the 8:38 mark with Notepad again that you can actually change the save preferences back to the orginal state where when you would close a .txt document and it would ask you if you wanted to save or save as.

- the third interesting point about the video around the 12:20 mark was if you want to open a specific file in Notepad from your directory in command prompt. in command prompt, you type in "notepad" followed by the Tab key which will bring up the first file in your directory that can be opened in notepad.
